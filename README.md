# Functional Programming with Haskell

This repository contains the material and code developed during my university classes on Functional Programming, using Haskell as the primary language.

## Content

The repository is organized into different sections that cover the main topics of Functional Programming, including:

### 1. Recursion
- **Simple recursion**: Basic examples of recursive functions.
- **Recursion techniques**: Advanced methods to optimize recursion.
- **General recursion**: Applications of recursion to solve more complex problems.

### 2. List Operations
- List manipulation, including filtering, mapping, and reducing elements.

### 3. Sorting and Recursion
- Implementation of sorting algorithms using recursion.

### 4. Combinators
- Using combinators to create more complex functions from simpler ones.

### 5. Simple Math Problem Solving
- Examples of solving mathematical problems using Haskell.

### 6. Recursive Types and Higher-Order Functions
- Creating and manipulating recursive types.
- Using higher-order functions for greater abstraction.

### 7. "Space Invaders" Game
- An implementation of the "Space Invaders" game made entirely in Haskell using [CodeWorld](https://code.world/haskell).
